# Hardware Configurations

This section describes possible hardware configurations that work or are in
progress of being built. Please include as much detail as you can, including
the processors, cabinets, BIOS, disk, ethernet controllers, switches, etc.

You may name your configuration anything you want. Ideally, create a directory
for your work under your own directory under the root for your content and
images. Reference your files from the appropriate hardware, software, and/or
configuration index files.

Specify your contribution as a link with a suitable name describing your
project.
