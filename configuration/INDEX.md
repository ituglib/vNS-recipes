# Subsystem Configurations

This section describes possible subsystem configurations that work or are in
progress of being built. This could include any custom settings associated with
CLIMs or other NonStop components that are outside the virtualization software.

You may name your configuration anything you want. Ideally, create a directory
for your work under your own directory under the root for your content and
images. Reference your files from the appropriate hardware, software, and/or
configuration index files.

Specify your contribution as a link with a suitable name describing your
project.
