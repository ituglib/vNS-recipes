# Software Configurations

This section describes possible virtualization software configurations that work
or are in progress of being built. Please include as much detail as you can,
including virtualization software and version, actual virtualization
configuration scripts, image captures, and the order in which your
configurations have been applied.

You may name your configuration anything you want. Ideally, create a directory
for your work under your own directory under the root for your content and
images. Reference your files from the appropriate hardware, software, and/or
configuration index files.

Specify your contribution as a link with a suitable name describing your
project.
